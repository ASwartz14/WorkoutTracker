No installation required just visit the website. Otherwise fork the repo and use node package manager to run npm i, then npm start and open your browser to localhost:8080.

## Usage

As a busy person trying to stay fit, I can use this app to track workouts and visualize progress.

## Contributing

I built this using UW Bootcamp's activities for reference using as much boilerplate code as I could find. I was tasked with creating the backend to a frontend already developed by UW Bootcamp/Trilogy. It is opensource so please feel free to fork and develop however you'd like.
